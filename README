    DESCRIPTION

    Change the locale (language/country/variant) of your phone. That's all.
    This app does one thing and does it well.

    Take note that if a locale is not supported by your phone or your app
    then you may not notice any change.

    The only permission required by this app is CHANGE_CONFIGURATION, which is
    needed to change the locale. There are no ads.

    Feedback and suggestions for improvement are most welcome.
